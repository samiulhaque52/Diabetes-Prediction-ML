# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts diabetes presence based on patient health data using Logistic Regression with StandardScaler for feature scaling.

## Dataset
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from UCI repository.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (zero values replaced by median)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression model training and testing
- Achieved accuracy: ~79%

## How to Run
- Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab
- Run all cells sequentially

## Results
